## Scenario 

Making recommendations to the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - on how they might work to increase participation rates of these exams by putting knowledge of basic statistics, Python programming concepts, and navigating files, packages, and libraries using the command line to the test. 

For this project, the following fundamental data science skills are practiced:
  - Describing data and performing methods of exploratory data analysis
  - Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to:
     - Create visualizations, and
     - Explore distributions of individual variables and relationships among pairs of variables

## Project Summary

### Problem statement: 
_How might the College Board work to increase participation rates of their exams?_

### Dataset

This project uses two datasets.

- See the source for the SAT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent).
- See the source for the ACT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows).

These data give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
  - Describing data through summary statistics and visualizations
  - Exploring feature distributions and relationships
